This file details the I/O contracts between modules, to ensure that they can be swapped easily.
As long as a module consumes its input contract and its output satisfies the next module's input contract, modules can be freely interchanged.

# Modules

## Input Validation

As it says on the tin, Input Validation modules consume a configuration file and test its parameters for validity so all future modules can assume their inputs are proper.

*In*: Json file (path taken as argument) to be validated. This file contains a topology, at least one test to execute against the topology, environmental conditions to apply to the topology’s links and nodes, and all required metadata (ssh information & credentials, test name, backend, OSM connection information, etc).

*Out*: Nothing (if the input file is valid) or warnings and errors printed to stdout.

## Terrain Data 

(currently projected to be satisfied by an OSM module)

*In*: Input file validated by input validation. Coordinator passes as arg1.

*Out*: Connection string that can be used by the frame generation module (should already be reflected in the input file; this would just provide confirmation).

## Frame Generation

*In*: 
- The input file validated by input validation. Coordinator passes as arg1.
- Connection string for accessing terrain data. Coordinator passes as arg2.

*Out*: Tarball/directory containing the original input file and all of the frames generated from its topology.

## Test Runner

*In*: Tarball generated by the Frame Generation module. Coordinator passes via stdin.

*Out*: Tarball containing raw output from the result of each test as it was printed/redirected. The exact format of the files in the tarball is as-of-yet undetermined.

## Coalesce Output

*In*: Tarball of raw output from all tests and nodes.

*Out*: Text file containing human and machine-friendly results collated from given tarball.

## Visualization

*In*: Collated results

*Out*: [arbitrary. Entirely dependent on the visualization technique employed by the specific implementation of this module]
