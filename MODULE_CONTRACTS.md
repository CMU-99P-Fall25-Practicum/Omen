This file details the I/O contracts between modules, to ensure that they can be swapped easily.
As long as a module consumes its input contract and its output satisfies the next module's input contract, modules can be freely interchanged.

# Modules

## Input Validation

As it says on the tin, Input Validation modules consume a configuration file and test its parameters for validity so all future modules can assume their inputs are proper.

*In*:
- arg1: Json file (path taken as argument) to be validated. This file contains a topology, at least one test to execute against the topology, environmental conditions to apply to the topology’s links and nodes, and all required metadata (ssh information & credentials, test name, backend, OSM connection information, etc).

*Out*: 
- stdout: warnings and errors related to the validity of the given input file.

example:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "loc": "root",
      "code": "<>",
      "msg": "<>"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```
## Terrain Data 

(currently projected to be satisfied by an OSM module)

*In*: 
- arg1: Input file validated by input validation.

*Out*: 
- stdout: Connection string that can be used by the frame generation module (should already be reflected in the input file; this would just provide confirmation).

## Test Runner

*In*: ???

*Out*: 
- stdout: path to a directory containing raw output from the result of each test as it was printed/redirected. The exact format of the files is as-of-yet undetermined.

## Coalesce Output

*In*: 
- arg1: path to a directory containing raw output from all tests and nodes.

*Out*: 
- stdout: Text file containing human and machine-friendly results collated from given tarball.

## Visualization

*In*: 
- arg1: path to a text file containing the human readable results generated by coalesce output

*Out*: [arbitrary. Entirely dependent on the visualization technique employed by the specific implementation of this module]
